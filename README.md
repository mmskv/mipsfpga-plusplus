# MIPSfpga++: Linux on Softcore MIPS on DE10-Lite FPGA

This repository provides all you need to run Linux on a Softcore MIPS processor
using a DE10-Lite FPGA board. It covers setting up software, starting the
processor, testing SDRAM, running Linux and executables on it.

## Prerequisites

- Terasic DE10-Lite board
- A modern Linux distribution
- USB to UART bridge
- FT2232 Adapter for OpenOCD with MPSSE support
- Serial terminal emulator (minicom is optional)
- Docker (Optional)
